# YouTube Clone
This repository contains a YouTube Clone project that I built as part of a course I was taking to learn **HTML and CSS**. 
The main goal of this project was to apply what I learnt and gain hands-on experience with front-end development.

## Features
- Video browsing and playback
- Layout and design inspired by YouTube
- Responsive user interface

## Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of my learning journey.  
I’m grateful for the course — it helped me understand **HTML and CSS** fundamentals, and I gained confidence in applying them to real projects.
I also learnt how to structure and style a real project.
Big thanks to Simon Bao.
